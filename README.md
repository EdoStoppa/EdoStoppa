### <p align="center" style="font-weight:bold">üëã <b>Hello World, nice to meet you!</b><p>
My name is Edoardo, now I'm partecipating in a **Double Degree Master Program in Computer Science** between the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi). I'm currently working on my Master's Thesis on `Dementia Detection`, using a mix of `NLP` and `Graph Machine Learning/Deep Learning`. During my time in Chcicago, I worked as Research Assistant on **Formal Verification** and **Performance Analysis** of complex **Parallel Data Structures**.
